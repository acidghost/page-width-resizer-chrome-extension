Body Width Resizer chrome extension
=========================================================
This **chrome extension** simply resizes the currently viewing page's body element, so that is's easier to read.

This dumb extension was born with the intent to shorten rows in the page (wikipedia's pages are really too damn large on a 27" display....)
